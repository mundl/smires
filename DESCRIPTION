Description: SMIRES is a COST Action addressing the Science and Management of Intermittent Rivers & Ephemeral Streams. SMIRES brings together more than 200 hydrologists, biogeochemists, ecologists, modellers, environmental economists, social researchers and stakeholders from 31 different countries to develop a research network for synthesising the fragmented, recent knowledge on IRES, improving our understanding of IRES and translating this into a science-based, sustainable management of river networks.
